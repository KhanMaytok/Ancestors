[b]So, is this a Naruto Mod?[/b]
The shinobi world is very rich and complex. Unfortunately, I don't think I have the time to fully dedicate myself to developing a complete mod on Naruto. This mod has transferred one of my favorite features to the world of Crusader Kings 2: The dojutsu.


[b]I have an old version. Are there breaking changes?[/b]
I tried to wrote events to no BC, but since the initial events are very different,[b] you should made a fresh campaign start.[/b].
If you want to check a complete list of changes in this new version, visit the [url=https://github.com/KhanMaytok/ancestors/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md]CHANGELOG.[/url]


[b]Your mod doesn't work with my set of mods. Can you fix that problem?[/b]
Yes of course. I can write a compatibility patch to work with your mod. Just drop a message [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1516819698/1863867579004156761/]here[/url]


[b]How can I get a Sharingan/Byakugan?[/b]
The mod has its own very small Lore. The initial sources of the dojutsu are two characters: Vee (sharingan) and Khalga (byakugan). Each Dojutsu comes with a parallel feature that is passed on to the descendants and serves as a method of control. The rules of transmission are as follows:

[list]
[*] Control traits are transmitted from parents to children, even when the father is unknown.
[*] The main trait can only appear when the character comes of age.
[*] There is a 7% chance that a character with the control trait will succeed in developing a dojutsu. If both parents are carriers, the probability rises to 15% (the same probability as for the genius trait in vanilla)
[*] If both parents have the control trait for byakugan and sharingan, there is a chance of inheriting both dojutsu. However, as this would give that character an undeniable advantage in the game, the acquisition of both traits will be accompanied by other not very favourable traits...
There is a very small chance of obtaining the Rinnegan by the above method.
[/list]

In the real life it is not the way in that genetics works, but dojutsu inheritance for this mod fits roleplay and strategic breeding. So, you should carefully monitor the traits of two characters before you marry them if you want to get opportunity to those wonderful eyes.


[b]Who is Khalga?[/b]
The original owner of the Byakugan is a wandering traveler, a lover of the good life and women. He has a tendency to visit the courts of female rulers and leave his seed there. After a maximum period of 5 years, Khalga will disappear from the court and move to another one, with different appearance, culture and religion. Therefore, Khalga is immortal, changing his body with every journey.

Khalga also has the trait of a doctor and will be appointed as a court physician automatically at every visit. If you're a female ruler, evets are in development.


[b]Vee?[/b]
Vee is the most beautiful woman in the world. Much more beautiful than Helen of Troy in her time, which causes her to be desired by many rulers. The ruler who marries her acquires a permanent monthly prestige bonus and a child every two years (to balance the Khalga events). Vee is also immortal, her cycle of renewal lasts 33 years, after which she returns to the form of a baby.

When she comes of age, Vee gets an event that decides which of her multiple single suitors in the game gets her. The one with the highest rank has the best chance of winning. For now this event is too simple, but work is underway to improve it.


[b]The Pentaghast[/b]
The Pentaghast are Vee's guests and she belongs to their dynasty. The Pentaghasts become patricians of Venice at the beginning of every game. If Venice is not available, in patricians of any merchant republic and if there are no merchant republics in the game, one is created at random. Therefore, this mod requires the type of merchant republic government to be present in the game.

Khalga, Vee and the Pentaghast will be provided with customized events as the mod is developed. For now, to ensure the survival of the Pentaghast, they have been given advantages already to the republic where they belong. One such advantage is one that successfully prevents any attempt to besiege their main province. Therefore, never besiege their home! You are warned.
